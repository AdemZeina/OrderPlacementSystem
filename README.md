The solution should be extendable by request from the customer (The moving company) and should be ready for production usage. 
Create an application that a sales consultant working at a moving company will use to place / find / edit / delete orders on behalf of customers.
The company that the sales consultant works at offers these services for their customers:
-Moving
-Packing
-Cleaning

When placing an order, the sales consultant will need the following information from the customer:
-Name
-Phone number
-Email
-Address he’s moving from
-Address he’s moving to
-What service they are ordering
-Date for when the service is to be carried out
-A text field where the sales consultant can add a note to the order, for example: “the customer won’t be available till 12 pm)

Create a web application that satisfies the following user stories.
User Stories:
 



Exercise 1 – Service API

Requirements: C# / .Net core - Web API. Entity Framework as the database layer.

Exercise 2 – Web
Write a web-application that satisfies the user stories. The web application will use the API built in exercise 1. 
Requirements: React, Vue or Angular preferred (Pure HTML / CSS / JS will be accepted. You can add any other js library if needed). Preferably, use GULP/Webpack to run and pack the web application.
